    	<p class="text">The Unique Convent  School,is a pioneer in education. It has a sprawling, picturesque area of land [originally consisting of 150 acres but less now due to the acquisition by the Government for road widening, new roads, storm water drainage, airport runway etc.] with a clear, little stream called Kalvalaire.</p>

        <p class="text">Education at UCS is a blend of modern educational pedagogy with traditional values imparted in heritage buildings. Students reflect this multi dimensional culture & tradition.  One can see a strong bond between the Student & Teacher, and Student & School. UCS focuses on all-round development of the student with equal importance accorded to Academics & Activities.</p>
